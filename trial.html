                  Our CEO, Peter, credits his hardworking East Asian immigrant
                  parents who undertook the arduous journey to the shores of
                  America with the intention of giving their children the best
                  future. His mother's wizardy in the kitchen whipping up the
                  tastiest dishes with whatever is available inexpensively at
                  the supermarket, was his first inspiration to create the
                  fusion cuisines for which
                  <em>The Frying Pan</em> became well known. He brings his zeal
                  for fusion cuisines to this restaurant, pioneering
                  cross-cultural culinary connections.

              Blessed with the most discerning gustatory sense, Agumbe, our CTO,
              personally ensures that every dish that we serve meets his
              exacting tastes. Our chefs dread the tongue lashing that ensues if
              their dish does not meet his exacting standards. He lives by his
